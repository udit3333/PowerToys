- **Authors:** Sakariya Ahmed
- **Spec Status:** Draft


# 1. Overview

## 1.1 Key definitions

Here are a few definitions of words found throughout this document to ensure clarity:  
- **Key Remapping:** Refers to the act of changing the output of a keystroke on your keyboard. An example is remapping the “Tab” key to “Delete”.
- **Shortcuts or Key shortcuts:** A combination of 2 or more keystrokes that results in a user-defined action. An example is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> un-doing an action in Microsoft Word
- **KSM:** Acronym for Keyboard Shortcut Manager
- **Keystroke:** A single press of a key
- **Exotic key:** These are keys that are unique and don’t exist on many keyboards. Example: Calculator or search button.

## 1.2 Press Release

Powertoys has just released a new utility called “Keyboard Shortcut Manager”! This keyboard manager enables customers to customize their computer on a keyboard level. With it, all the keys on your keyboard are dynamic and can be remapped to provide different outputs.

Ever switched computers and the shortcut to search your computer was different? Or change the keys you press an app you use often? This utility is perfect if you’re always looking to be more efficient on your computer or are a long-time user of a different OS and want to bring your keypresses and shortcuts with you!

## 1.3 Elevator Pitch 

A keyboard is an extremely powerful and primary method of interacting with your operating system, and historically Windows has lacked the configurability to make this power extend to you, the user. With this new addition to Powertoys you gain access to the keyboards potential with the ability to remap keys and create user-defined keyboard shortcuts.
 
## 1.4 Tweet  

*"Ever wish you could change some shortcuts and edit keyboard buttons? Or switch computers and your keyboard was slightly different? PowerToys is here to solve all your keyboard woes with a Keyboard Shortcut Manager! Customize your experience by remapping keys or creating new shortcuts!"*

## 1.5 Narrative / Scenario  

**User Problem 1** - Mac/Linux “switch” users: A user who has recently made the switch to Windows and is having trouble adjusting to the keyboard differences. Simple tasks like locking the computer, copy / paste, and switching browsers now require thinking and the lack of muscle memory makes the user feels clumsy at times. For example, copying an object on MacOS, <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, requires your thumb whereas on Windows, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, it’s your pinky. Even within identical applications there are shortcut disparities. Going to the address bar in Google Chrome on a Mac is <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>, on a PC, that would map to <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>.
 
**Outcome**: A successful KSM manager would increase comfortability and users wouldn’t feel like they lost functionality or convenience with switching to Windows 10. In effect, it would help decrease churn and avoid a negative experience for a new user, which is crucial moment for public sentiment on Windows.

 **User Problem 2** – Users want customizability to make them faster: Developers, or power users, who use their keyboard a lot are constantly looking to save themselves time and make their processes more convenient. This community has largely relied on 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools or has left their keys alone but voiced frustration with the lack of a native tool to remap keys. An example of a power shortcut that made its way into Windows is <kbd>![Windows Key][winlogo]</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd>. You used to have to hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Del</kbd> then click “Lock”.

**Outcome**: A successful KSM manager would ‘unlock’ functionality and convenience for many power users, increasing their everyday efficiency. Keyboard changes are highly visible and successfully extending control would greatly boost satisfaction to continue to cement Windows as the *ideal* platform for a developer.

## 1.6 Customers

We have two primary customers:

- **Developers/PowerUsers** of Windows10 that want a built-in and lightweight solution to remap their own hotkeys which will increase their efficiency in completing tasks.
- **Former Linux and MacOS** users who now use Windows and would like to utilize their former keyboard shortcuts to get rid of the learning period and ease the transition to using a new device.

## 1.7 Problem Statement and Supporting Customer Insights

 Windows 10 is available on a multitude of devices and as such, various keyboard inputs are utilized to access the UI. The Keyboard and eyboard Shortcuts are an integral way of teracting with Windows and users have had difficulty accessing them when they have non-standard keyboards or knowledge of shortcuts from a different OS.
 
Comfortability/Ease of use, especially for new users, can be crucial as their first few interactions can cause frustration and result in a higher churn towards competitors. For developers and some seasoned users, where using their keyboard is a large part their job, ability
to remap keystrokes and engage executables can lead to massive gains in time. In fact, this was the [second most popular topic](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/6) measured through thumbs up and the most commented issue in the PowerToys Github.

## 1.8  Solutions or Expectations  
To make-up for the lack of a built-in solutions users that have come across this issue only once often rely on learning the basic windows shortcuts and forgoing additional productivity. For users where this has become an ongoing concern, the vast majority who switch to the Powertoy will come with certain expectations as they have come to rely on a multitude of 3<sup>rd</sup> party solutions. 28% of survey respondents used 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools, and 60% of those who did used either AutoHotKey or SharpKeys.

*Various 3<sup>rd</sup> party solutions:*

 The following are the most popular 3<sup>rd</sup> party apps across
 different operating systems:

- AutoHotkey
- SharpKeys
- Karabiner (MacOS)

**Sharpkeys** is an open source application created for Windows that allows the user to remap keys through their computer’s registry. It was created to make the process of accessing the registry and reprogramming keys more convenient for advanced users and accessible for casual users. The Sharpkeys GUI (*Figure 1*) allows users to keep track of remapped keys and import/export key configurations. When users try to remap a key, they can do it through pressing the key on their keyboard or selecting the key from a drop-drown menu. Both are exhaustive for North American users and the SharpKeys community is currently working to expanding their support for even more international keyboards. Sharpkeys requires a restart but doesn’t require elevated permissions or to run in the background. It does not support the remapping of key combinations or shortcuts. Additionally, it is unable to remap keys that cannot be remapped from Windows registry access: Fn, Windows, Calculator, etc.

**AutoHotKey** is a scripting language that runs on Windows and while it focuses on and was first created to remap keys and create shortcuts, it is capable of a lot more. Using AHK requires spending time reading their extensive documentation (*Figure 3)* to become adept at writing scripts. There is no GUI or interface that comes with AHK and it is all interpreted through a text editor. With AHK users can create both OS-level and app-specific shortcuts, however there is no simple way to share/save key configurations among multiple users. AHK has a very strong community that has been able to create tools that fill in many of the language’s functionality gaps.

**Karabiner** is a MacOS solution for users to remap their keys. Karabiner’s interface (*Figure 4)* is intuitive and accessible to both beginner and advanced users. It is capable of what it calls “simple modifications, which are just remapping a single key to another key. Karabiner has support for multiple keyboards and the user can target a specific device or all devices for any remapping. Complex modifications (*Figure 5)* are defined by Karabiner as creating/editing shortcuts that consist of multiple key presses or mapping a shortcut to a single key. These complex modifications can be imported from Karabiners website where the community has created a vast array of key configurations. If you cannot find a suitable configuration, a user can create their own by using the terminal to open Karabiner’s JSON file. After learning the syntax from the reference manual, this JSON file can be edited to automatically add new user-defined rules.

## 1.9 Survey Results  

A brief survey was sent to the Windows Developer community during the planning stage of this utility. The consumer research was then used to inform this functional spec and test the preliminary hypothesis. Here’s a summary of the survey results

- *Question*: Do you currently use any third-party tools to remap keys and/or create shortcuts?
  - Nearly 30% of survey respondents used 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools. This indicates that there is not only a real demand for the utility and many users currently remap their keys.

- *Question*: Which third party tools do you use to remap keys and create shortcuts?
  - The most popular 3<sup>rd</sup> party tool was AutoHotKey, followed by SharpKeys. Karabiner was not mentioned as this was sent to Windows developers but it was still highlighted in the competitive research due to its popularity among Mac users.
  
- *Question*: If you could improve the way that you manage your remap keys and create shortcuts using the third-party tools, what would you change?  
  - Over 50% of survey respondents asked for either native integration into Windows and / or a pleasant UI experience instead of scripting. This confirmed the decision to ensure users can engage with all of the utility’s functionality through a UI.

- *Question*: What features would you most like in in a keyboard shortcut manager besides remapping keys?
  - \~70% of users requested shortcuts, either app-level or OS level, with OS shortcuts being the most demanded. This helped us prioritize the different features we planned in the functional spec.

- *Question*: If remapping your keyboard required a restart, would you still use this PowerToy?   
  - Before design, we were intimately aware that this could be a pain point for many users. Over 60% of respondents answered 'Yes', providing confidence that a restart, if necessary, is possible.

## 1.10 Goals / Non-Goals

#### *Goals*
- The KSM can be used to configure keypresses on Windows 10 with any built-in / external keyboard
- The KSM provides an intuitive and lightweight UI experience (53% of survey respondents who use 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools wanted integration into Windows and/or a UI)
- The KSM will be able to remap keys
- The KSM will be able to edit OS-level shortcuts
- The KSM will work with all keyboards, regardless of locale (Example: Japanese keyboard)

#### *Stretch Goals*
- The KSM will be able to edit app-level shortcuts

#### *Non-Goals*
- Require a reboot only when absolutely necessary (42% of survey respondents would not use this PowerToy if reboot was required)

###  2.6 Functional Requirements Open Questions / Concerns
    
#### 2.6.1 Circular reference
- When two or more keys are remapped to each other the logic needs to ensure there is never a loop and clear indication regarding priority order of operations.

#### 2.6.2 WinKey Priority and Access
- Should certain shortcuts be restricted to the user? Example: <kbd>![Windows Key][winlogo]</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>

#### 2.6.3 Multiple Keyboards – Shortcut support
- Currently, there exists no plan to incorporate the creation of shortcuts for specific keyboards. Is this an expected use case?

#### 2.6.4 SharpKey / AHK Partnership
- SharpKey has weak copy-left license (Ms-PL Microsoft Public License) and we need to evaluate whether any of its codebase is useful. AutoHotKey’s scripting model could help us but we need to validate if its possible / if it's a good idea. 52% of survey respondents who used 3<sup>rd</sup> party tools used AHK and 68% used either AHK or Sharpkeys.

#### 2.6.5 Elevated Permissions
- Is consistently running elevated (aka run as admin) required for the Keyboard Shortcut Manager?

#### 2.6.6 F-Key / Fn key ignore
- Can we have a setting that makes <kbd>Fn</kbd> keys (i.e <kbd>F1</kbd>-<kbd>F12</kbd>) always act like function keys?
